E-Commerce Data Warehouse Project

Overview
This project implements an E-Commerce Data Warehouse to analyze and manage e-commerce data effectively. By leveraging PostgreSQL and Python, the project enables efficient data storage, ETL processes, and business insights.

Features
- Seamless PostgreSQL integration for managing e-commerce datasets.
- ETL pipelines to automate data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- Analytical capabilities to derive key business insights and performance metrics.

Business Insights
The project provides answers to critical business questions, including:
1. Peak Season Analysis: Identifies the months with the highest order volumes.
2. User Activity Patterns: Determines the time of day users are most likely to place orders.
3. Payment Preferences: Analyzes the most popular payment methods among customers.
4. Installment Trends: Calculates the average number of installments used for payments.
5. Average Order Processing Time: Measures the average time taken to complete orders.
6. State-Wise Purchase Frequency: Examines the frequency of purchases across different states.
7. Logistics Traffic: Identifies the busiest logistics routes based on order volumes.
8. Late Deliveries and Customer Satisfaction: Analyzes the impact of late deliveries on customer feedback and satisfaction.
9. Delivery Delays by State: Tracks average shipping delays across states.
10. Delivery Time Differences: Measures discrepancies between estimated and actual delivery times.

Libraries Used
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: For numerical operations.
- psycopg2: For PostgreSQL integration.
- matplotlib: For data visualization.
- seaborn: For advanced visualization.
- configparser: For configuration file handling.

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL 13 or higher
- A working environment for Jupyter Notebooks (e.g., Anaconda)

Setup and Configuration
1. Install the required libraries using your preferred package manager.
2. Configure the database credentials in the config.ini file.
3. Use the provided Jupyter Notebook to perform data analysis and generate insights.

Usage
- Extract, transform, and load (ETL) data into the data warehouse.
- Analyze business metrics using the summarized insights.
- Visualize key trends to support decision-making.

Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time data streams.
- Deployment of predictive models for advanced analytics.
- Interactive dashboards for real-time data visualization.
