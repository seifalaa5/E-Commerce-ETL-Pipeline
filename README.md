# E-Commerce Data Warehouse Project

## 📖 Overview
This project implements an **E-Commerce Data Warehouse** to manage and analyze e-commerce data effectively. By leveraging PostgreSQL and Python, the project enables efficient data storage, ETL processes, and insightful analytics to support data-driven decision-making.

## ✨ Features
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: A robust database backend for data storage and management.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Automates data extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
- **Business Insights**: Analyze key metrics and trends for enhanced decision-making.
- **Configurable Setup**: Easily adaptable database configurations using a dedicated `config.ini` file.

## 📊 Business Insights
This project provides answers to key business questions:
1. **Peak Season Analysis**: Identifies months with the highest order volumes.
2. **User Activity Patterns**: Determines peak times when users are most active.
3. **Payment Preferences**: Highlights preferred payment methods among customers.
4. **Installment Trends**: Shows the average number of installments for payments.
5. **Order Processing Time**: Calculates the average time taken to fulfill orders.
6. **State-Wise Purchases**: Tracks purchase frequency across various states.
7. **Logistics Traffic**: Identifies the busiest logistics routes.
8. **Impact of Late Deliveries**: Analyzes how late deliveries affect customer satisfaction.
9. **Delivery Delays by State**: Measures average shipping delays in different states.
10. **Delivery Time Differences**: Tracks discrepancies between estimated and actual delivery times.
